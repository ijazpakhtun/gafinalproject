GAFINALPROJECT
2. Generation Australia Final Project
3.  This project was entirely made with the power of 

5) Visual Studio Code, 
6) elements of HTML5,
7)  CSS, Bootstrap, 
8)  JavaScript and with the 
9)  inclusion of React. Also, 
10)  we used Git and GitHub and 
11)  Chrome Developer Tools.
12. This our initial wireframe design, which we then later on improved and add on, such as when you click on add task, it locally saves the new information to the file, so when you add a new task and reload the page, the task added will stay and not delete itself
13. In our form we have 5 mandatory inputs, and after having filled out the form, upon clicking the submit button display the task name and all required information is displayed in a separate card.
14. The Bootstrap components we used were cards, icons, word modal, badge and buttons.
15. With the use of github we created separate branch for each member, so everytime a member would make a change to the file or edit it in anyway, they could commit their changes to the github, where one of the other members would authorise the pull request, since we possessed the trust for eachother.
